1. Have a switching method function that can switch between the speaking mode and the texting mode. Whenever Jarvis recieves a text that says only "Switch" regardless of the mode he switches, or the speaking mode can have a switch function that switches him to texting, and the texting mode switches him back to speaking. But I think the texting method is better.

2. During the texting mode Have a search every 2 seconds for a text message from the email api that is as recent as 2 seconds.

3. If that is seen, grab the text file, interpret it, and send it to the model. Once the model outputs, package that back up and send it to the phone.
